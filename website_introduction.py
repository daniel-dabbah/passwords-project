    st.write('''
    In an age of increasing data breaches, understanding password strength is essential to enhancing personal and organizational security.
    Our interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of breached passwords and offers real-time insights on the security of passwords users create.
    Whether youâ€™re curious about common password vulnerabilities or want to check the robustness of your own password, this tool is designed to help.

    ## Explore Our Dashboard
    Our application offers three key sections:
    
    1. **Breached Password Analysis**:  
       Analyze a dataset of breached passwords to uncover patterns in password creation, including length distribution, character composition, and common vulnerabilities. Visualizations reveal key insights into how passwords from real-world breaches compare in terms of strength and predictability.
    
    2. **Check Your Password Statistics**:  
       Input your password to see how it compares to others in terms of length, character variety, and more. This page provides detailed statistics, showing how your password ranks against breached passwords and highlights areas where it could be improved.
    
    3. **Check Your Password Strength**:  
       Evaluate the strength of your password in real-time. Our algorithm calculates an entropy score, detects patterns or weaknesses, and suggests improvements. The password strength is measured on a scale of 0 to 10, helping you ensure that your password is resilient against cracking attempts.
